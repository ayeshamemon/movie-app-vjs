# movie-app-vjs

This is a basic movie app.
It has a  search feature.You can search for a movie and you will get the results of searched movie.
You can also play the videos of the searched movies.

In this project i have used HTML5, CSS3 and Pure Javascript.
No libraries or frameworks have been used here.

In this project i have made API calls to get the results of the searched movie.

The output of the code along with screenshots have been added to the output folder.

Thank you!
